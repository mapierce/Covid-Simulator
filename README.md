# Covid Simulator
## 🤔 About
After reading the [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) about the speed of the coronavirus, I got to thinking about how I could rebuild such simulations. Hence, this project was born. 

The first goal of the project was to recreate the simulation at its most basic and publish for use. After that, it should become possible to create other scenarios to simulate: self isolation; differing incubation periods; etc.
